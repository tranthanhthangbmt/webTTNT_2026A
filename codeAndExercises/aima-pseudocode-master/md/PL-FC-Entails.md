&emsp;_inferred_ &larr; a table, where _inferred_\[_s_\] is initially _false_ for all symbols  
&emsp;_agenda_ &larr; a queue of symbols, initially symbols known to be true in _KB_

__Figure__ ?? The forward-chaining algorithm for propositional logic. The _agenda_ keeps track of symbols known to be true but not yet "processed". The _count_ table keeps track of how many premises of each implication are as yet unknown. Whenever a new symbol _p_ from the agenda is processed, the count is reduced by one for each implication in whose premise _p_ appears (easily identified in constant time with appropriate indexing.) If a count reaches zero, all the premises of the implication are known, so its conclusion can be added to the agenda. Finally, we need to keep track of which symbols have been processed; a symbol that is already in the set of inferred symbols need not be added to the agenda again. This avoids redundant work and prevents loops caused by implications such as _P_ &rArr; _Q_ and _Q_ &rArr; _P_.
