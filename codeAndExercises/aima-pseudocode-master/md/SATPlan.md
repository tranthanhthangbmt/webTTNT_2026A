__Figure__ ?? The SATPlan algorithm. The planning problem is translated into a CNF sentence in which the goal is asserted to hold at a fixed time step _t_ and axioms are included for each time step up to _t_. If the satisfiability algorithm finds a model, then a plan is extracted by looking at those proposition symbols that refer to actions and are assigned _true_ in the model. If no model exists, then the process is repeated with the goal moved one step later.
